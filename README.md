# 📦 Automated Barcode Reader

A lightweight, web-based **barcode reader** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It uses your device's camera to scan and decode barcodes in real-time directly from the browser — no additional software or installations required.

## 🚀 Features

* 📷 Real-time barcode scanning using webcam or mobile camera
* 📦 Supports common barcode types (QR Code, EAN, Code 128, and more)
* 🧠 Runs entirely in the browser — no backend or server setup
* 💡 Easy to customize and integrate into other projects
* 📱 Mobile-responsive design

## 🛠️ Built With

* **HTML5** – For structure and video input
* **CSS3** – For responsive design and layout
* **JavaScript** – Core logic for barcode detection
* **Barcode library** – Uses [QuaggaJS](https://github.com/serratus/quaggaJS) *(or jsQR if preferred)* for decoding barcodes

## 📂 Project Structure

```
/barcode-reader
│
├── index.html        # Main UI and video element
├── style.css         # Application styling
├── script.js         # Camera handling and barcode scanning logic
└── /libs             # Barcode decoding libraries (e.g., QuaggaJS, jsQR)
```

## 🧪 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/barcode-reader.git
   cd barcode-reader
   ```

2. **Launch the app:**

   * Open `index.html` in a browser
   * Or serve it with a simple web server:

     ```bash
     npx serve .
     ```

3. **Grant camera access** when prompted.

4. **Point your camera at a barcode** — decoded content will appear on the screen.

> ⚠️ For best results, run the app using `localhost` or over HTTPS, as browsers block camera access over unsecured HTTP.

## ✅ Supported Barcode Formats

*Depends on the library you use* (e.g., QuaggaJS supports):

* EAN-13 / EAN-8
* Code 128 / Code 39
* UPC-A / UPC-E
* QR Code (with additional libraries like `jsQR`)

## 🔧 Customization Tips

* Change the **UI styles** in `style.css`
* Adjust barcode **scanner settings** in `script.js`
* Hook into scan results to **trigger other actions**, like form submissions or API calls

## 🔐 Permissions

* The app requests **camera access** for live scanning
* All processing happens **locally in the browser**
* No personal data is collected or sent externally
